When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To allow other persons to collaborate to my project and have a copy in case
    of my computer crashes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When pulling, Git automatically merges what is on remote repo, that may
    introduce new issues in the code I am working on. Moreover, if there are a
    lot of contributors, Git would have to make a lot of pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Forks are a concept of GitHub. It allows copying a GitHub repo into yours
    GitHub repos. Link to original repo also appears.
    - Clones are local copy of another local repo, or a remote one. Reference
    to original author is lost.
    - Branches are copies of code inside one repo, local or remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
