When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To allow other persons to collaborate to my project and have a copy in case
    of my computer crashes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When pulling, Git automatically merges what is on remote repo, that may
    introduce new issues in the code I am working on. Moreover, if there are a
    lot of contributors, Git would have to make a lot of pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Forks are a concept of GitHub. It allows copying a GitHub repo into yours
    GitHub repos. Link to original repo also appears.
    - Clones are local copy of another local repo, or a remote one. Reference
    to original author is lost.
    - Branches are copies of code inside one repo, local or remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows to work in offline mode, by fetching before the disconnected period.
    Also permits working in a branch without any further external activity.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without these tools, It would be possible to collaborate by sharing files
    stored on a distant server for example. It would be easier to directly edit
    file without having to clone a repo nor making frequent commits. But it
    would be impossible that two collaborators work at the same time, nor
    propose updates without editing original files. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
