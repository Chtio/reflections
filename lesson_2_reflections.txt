What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git adds an hidden metadata folder called ".git" but don't make any initial
  commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  It is only a temporary space used before committing, allowing user to custom
  contents to commit.
