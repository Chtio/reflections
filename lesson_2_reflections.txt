What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git adds an hidden metadata folder called ".git" but don't make any initial
  commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  It is only a temporary space used before committing, allowing user to custom
  contents to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  By adding my working directory modifications to the staging area using the
  "git add" command. Then "git diff --staged" displays difference between
  staging area and last commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Branches would be helpful for adding progressively experimental features or
  translations. Branches help by making those modification without impacting
  initial project yet, i.e. the master branch.
