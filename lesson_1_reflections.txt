How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By highlighting the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Helps doing file comparison simple.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    - Helps cutting your work as you wish;
    - Every logical diff is slightly different so it makes it possible to ajust.
    - Prob. less records
    Cons:
    - not automatic: you have to remember to commit
    - longest

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Cause in code development, modification to one file probably affects other
    files of the project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see the commits messages and IDs, git diff to see actual changes
    between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By providing branches and/or changing HEAD of the repo

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making changes, push/pull repo or banches.
